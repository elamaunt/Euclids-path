  GeometricTypeIILiouville — the Liouville normal form and the one-wing twin criterion: a SECOND
  explicit 🔴 route to twins, parallel to `CRE`.

  ORIGIN (parity_wall Prime-Chaos session dossier §10 / §11 / §12 / §13). On the `X^{1/3}`-rough set
  every `n ≤ X` has `Ω(n) ∈ {1,2}`, so `1_ℙ(n) = ρ_y(n)(1 − λ(n))/2` (§10, `λ = (−1)^Ω`).  Expanding
  the two-wing product gives the three-residual Liouville form `T = ¼(A − L_− − L_+ + L_±)` (§11) and
  the semiprime-corner form `T = A − B_− − B_+ + C`, `L_± = 2B_± − A` (§12).  Since `C ≥ 0`,
  `T ≥ −½(L_− + L_+)`; hence if the pair-rough count is positive and the summed one-wing Liouville
  bias is negative (`L_− + L_+ < 0`), then `T > 0` — infinitely many twin centers.

  This module builds the SECOND named twin target (mirroring `twins_of_typeII`): the open analytic
  input is `OneWingTarget` (pair-rough positivity + negative parity bias, cofinally), and the
  reduction to `IsTwinCenter` is machine-checked and axiom-clean.

  WHAT IS PROVED (std axioms, no sorry, no new axioms):
    * `prime_liouville_form` — `1_ℙ(n) = (1 − (−1)^{Ω(n)})/2` for `Ω(n) ∈ {1,2}` (§10);
    * `one_wing_lower` — `T ≥ −½(L_− + L_+)` (the §12 corner bound);
    * `twinCenter_of_oneWing` — a window with `C ≥ 0` and `L_− + L_+ < 0` contains a twin center;
    * `twins_of_oneWing` — `OneWingProgram ⟹ ∀ N, ∃ m > N, IsTwinCenter m` (green-conditional, the
      SECOND 🔴 target).

  DISCLOSURE. `OneWingTarget` is an open analytic input (a named `Prop`, not a `sorry`).  The §13
  heuristic (`1 : log 2` margin) is now a PER-WING THEOREM at count level: on the FULL rough minus
  window with `X^7 ≤ z^20 ≤ X^9`, eventually `Σ λ(6m−1) ≤ −(1/40)·X/log X`
  (`minus_wing_sign`, Engine/GeometricTypeIIWingSign — unconditional, axiom-clean, via the
  campaign's PNT-in-progressions `apCount_mul_log_div_tendsto`; the plus wing is named, unclaimed
  work).  This does NOT discharge, shrink, or reweight `OneWingTarget`: the target needs BOTH wings
  rough on ONE window with SUMMED negative bias (`L_− + L_+ < 0` against the SAME pair-rough `A`),
  and any valid instantiation forces twin-count > 0 by pigeonhole — the surviving open core is
  exactly the PAIR-ROUGH two-wing coupling; three per-wing→pair-rough bridges were refuted.
  Nothing here proves twins.  twin sorry untouched.

/-! ## Grounding the rough hypothesis in actual integers (§10)

The `Ω(n) ∈ {1,2}` hypothesis of `prime_liouville_form` is now DISCHARGED from real arithmetic:
`n < y³` with all prime factors `> y` forces `Ω(n) ≤ 2` (three factors, each `> y`, would exceed
`y³`), and `n < y²` forces primality.  This is exact bookkeeping: it grounds the dichotomy on the
actual rough set and NOTHING MORE — it carries NO information about the SIGN or the size of the
one-wing Liouville bias `L₋ + L₊`; the open content of `OneWingTarget` (pair-rough positivity plus
the negative bias) is untouched and is NOT made more plausible by this grounding. -/

/-! ## The corner-form discharge: target B shrinks to ONE sign condition (§12 / §68)

The registered target `OneWingTarget` bundles six conjuncts.  Below, five of them are discharged
CONSTRUCTIVELY: the corner-form count identity `T = |I| − B₋ − B₊ + C` is exact inclusion–exclusion
over ANY finite window, `C ≥ 0` is a cardinality, and the `L`-relations are definitional.  The
surviving open content of target B is exactly ONE analytic sign condition — cofinally there is a
window above `N` with FEWER composite wings than window points (`B₋ + B₊ < |I|`, i.e. the mean
composite-wing count is below 1; on the rough set this IS the negative Liouville bias
`L₋ + L₊ < 0`).

HONESTY. The intended windows are the PAIR-ROUGH sets (where every wing has `Ω ∈ {1,2}`, composite
means semiprime, and the dossier's `1 : log 2` heuristic margin makes the sign condition the
plausible open content); for RAW windows the condition is expected to FAIL for large `N` (prime
density decays) — choosing a good window family is part of the open problem, not discharged here.
This is a §110 criterion-C event on the REGISTERED target B: to close `OneWingTarget` it now
suffices to prove the single sign condition.  No equivalence is claimed, and no new open `Prop`
is introduced (the sign condition is a PREMISE of a theorem, phrased in the target's own
vocabulary). -/

/-! ## The surviving remainder of target B, in its canonical Liouville form

On PAIR-ROUGH windows (both wings with `Ω ∈ {1,2}` — discharged from real arithmetic by
`rough_omega_le_two` in the critical range) the sign condition of `oneWingTarget_of_sign` is
LITERALLY the negative two-wing Liouville bias: `Σ_{m∈I} λ(6m−1) + Σ_{m∈I} λ(6m+1) < 0` with
`λ = (−1)^Ω`.  This is the dossier's §12/§68 form of residual B, now the SINGLE surviving
analytic statement of the one-wing route.

HONESTY. This is Chowla-adjacent strength — a signed two-point correlation of `λ` along the
twin configuration, the purest known form of the parity wall on route B.  Rewriting the sign
condition in the canonical `λ`-vocabulary does NOT make it easier; it makes it impossible to
misread.  No new open `Prop`; the premise is a hypothesis of a theorem. -/
