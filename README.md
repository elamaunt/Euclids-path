A consolidation of the proof programme for the **twin-prime conjecture**, built around
**Euclid's perpetual engine** (the impossibility of an infinite "clean" descent — a version of
Fermat's infinite descent).

This is **not a finished proof**. It is a machine-checkable assembly in which the conjecture is
reduced to a **single** open node, and the whole path — from the engine's laws to the final
reduction — is visible across the numbered files.

> **Paper.** An arXiv-style write-up of the whole programme (LaTeX + PDF) is attached to the
> [latest release](https://github.com/elamaunt/Euclids-path/releases/latest) and is being prepared for
> publication. What still changes is mostly the **prose** — the exposition is being refined; the
> mathematical content and the machine-checked results are settled.

## Map: one engine — seven branches, a zoo and geometry

At the foundation lies a single physical prohibition: **the impossibility of a perpetual engine**
(`no_infinite_descent`, the bare Lean core). Seven great questions turn out to be its shadows on
different objects. The structural half of each is proved **green** (where the engine is forbidden,
there is no deviation); and the last step — the tie to a real object — is either accepted by the
**single first-cause axiom** `step00FirstCause` (three yellow decree boundaries), or remains a green
conditional theorem, or stays an open 🔴 input. A through-line discussion is in the
[prologue](prose/00_Overview.en.md).

**Universal form** (`Engine/UniversalEngine`): the engine is defined over ANY relation
(`PerpetualEngine`), and its impossibility follows from an internal cause: the definition is an
infinite strict descent, and well-foundedness is exactly its prohibition
(`no_perpetual_engine_of_wellFounded`; `perpetualEngine_iff_not_wellFounded`). It carries into any
space with an ℕ-rank (`no_perpetual_engine_of_rank` — every front is a corollary of one theorem; EPMI
is shown as an instance). But not "everywhere": on the continuum ℝ the engine **works**
(`perpetualEngine_on_real`) — which makes Euclid's path a **controller**
(`universal_engine_dividing_line`, M6): it decides where motion is forbidden (the discrete) and where
it is realised (the continuum). The core is mathlib well-foundedness; the contribution is
formalisation-unifying; the taint is unchanged.

Colours: 🟢 — machine-proved under standard axioms (the structural part / a green conditional
theorem); 🟡 — AXIOM-TAINTED, conditional on the first cause (the object accepted by decree at an
honestly disclosed price); 🔴 — an open input (the real object: the QFT spectrum, the primes'
Hamiltonian, a Leray solution, the `(p,p)`-classes, a Turing machine — absent from the formalisation).
⏸️ — the problem is examined but its boundary is NOT taken: deferred by heuristic sign (Mersenne, Fermat)
or a zoo front with no field (§16–17). ✗ — the decree was taken and FELL (Collatz, refuted at n = 27).
Collatz went through the full cycle of the discipline: its rope law was the **fourth boundary** of
`step00FirstCause` — and it was machine-REFUTED (`ropeLaw_universal_refuted`, witness n = 27); the
tripwire fired, the boundary was removed, the decree path closed by a forged refutation. The green
front is `Engine/CollatzTugOfWar`, the post-mortem `Engine/CollatzFirstCause`
(chapters [55](prose/55_Collatz.en.md)–[56](prose/56_CollatzFirstCause.en.md)).

**The arithmetic zoo (ch. 44–48, all 🟢, no fields taken).** The same manifestation apparatus is run
through six new number-theoretic stories: cousins and sexy primes (Polignac), Sophie Germain,
Goldbach, Legendre, odd perfect numbers, Fermat numbers. All are green and conditional only on the
definitions of the laws; not a single open problem is solved or declared. The gem is the **green
Euler–Lagrange classic**: SG-primes with `p ≡ 3 (mod 4)` divide the Mersenne number `M_p` (23 ∣ M₁₁),
a formal fragment of the very heuristic whose sign defers the Mersenne boundary (§16). The trilemmas
are passed everywhere, but no fields are taken, deliberately (§17): five stories carry the sign "for"
(like Riemann), Fermat the sign "against" (stronger than Mersenne); for Goldbach/Legendre/perfect the
witness is pointwise **decidable** (decide) — the strongest non-presentability. The only unconditional
green theorem about primes here is **Bertrand** (a prime desert does not survive doubling), and it is
disclosed honestly why Legendre needs more than it.

**Geometry of the path (ch. 49, 🟢 + 2 🟡).** The concrete descent graph is read geometrically: the
arrow of time (`lexRank` only falls), the **computed curvature** `κ = 1 − outdeg` (spectrum from −8 to
+1, discrete Gauss–Bonnet `χ(cone3) = −5`), "flatness everywhere ⟹ a perpetual engine", and the
irony — Euclid's path violates Euclid's own **second postulate** (a line cannot be extended without
bound), and so there are no parallels. The intersection of lines is proved 🟡 from the **same** first
cause (exactly two axiom-tainted declarations, no new field), but it cannot be known from within (🟢) —
the knowledge would cost an engine. **Navier–Stokes on ℝ³** (a postscript to ch. 41): the box-class
energy balance is **derived green**, the divergence theorem genuinely engaged; the cascade smoothness
of this class is decree-free. **The Clay reduction** (`Engine/NavierStokesClayReduction`): the exact
Clay-(A) statement is encoded, and the logical reduction "known theory (Kato + Beale–Kato–Majda) + one
criterion `GlobalVorticityControl` ⟹ Clay-(A)" is proved green — the single open theorem is
**isolated and named** (vorticity control, the supercriticality barrier). NS is **not solved and not
declared solved**; it is machine-recorded that the engine surrogate is **strictly weaker** than the
criterion (`greenBudget_strictly_weaker_than_vorticityControl`, via a non-uniform cascade) — the
engine reading does **not** close the problem.
**A discrete fluid model** (`Engine/CascadeBudget`, `Engine/DyadicBlowup`, `Engine/DyadicFirstCause`,
[chapter 52](prose/52_DyadicModel.en.md)): probably **the first formalisation of a fluid model** in a
proof assistant (known mathematics: the budget principle + the Katz–Pavlović model). A machine map of
the boundary of the engine reading: where it works (budget ⟹ finite time under UNIFORM dissipation)
and where it breaks (`superlinear_blowup_sq` + `dyadic_blowup` — the cascade **blows up**, the engine
is REALISED). The connecting cascade-drive `y'≥C·y²` is now **derived from the raw λⁿ relations** — for
the exact self-similar solution (`ssLead_drive`) and for a whole class through a front invariant
(`frontDrive_of_invariant`): a monolithic named hypothesis is narrowed to a smaller,
coordinate-close invariant; the only isolated input left open is front persistence for infinitely many
modes (the moving KP front). And the source of the cascade (the pump `n=0`, uncausable from within — 🟢
`dyadicOrigin_uncausable_from_inside`) is **decreed by the first cause** (🟡 `DyadicFirstCause`, via
`nsBoundary`): the fluid blow-up joins the masks through its own `0`. There is no new MATHEMATICS (the
Tao barrier); the novelty is in the formalisation. NS is not solved.

## Structure

- **`EuclidsPath/Engine/*.lean`** — the main (proved) line: the engine and its laws → reduction to the
  twins → attack lines → the final node. Imported by the root `EuclidsPath.lean` **in the order of the
  proof's progression**.
- **`prose/NN_*.md`** — the paired prose, the same through numbering 00→50 (+ appendix `A`), a single
  academic narrative: engine → twins → first cause and THE MAIN THEOREM → side branches → the
  arithmetic zoo (44–48) → the geometry of the path (49) → the coda (50). English siblings live in
  `prose/NN_*.en.md`.
- **`tools/`** — numerical harnesses (`*_harness.py`) and results (`RESULTS_*.md`);
  **`tools/fractal/`** — visualisation of Euclid's fractal (8 kinds: descent forest, rank field, twin
  spiral, load landscape, the line of centres with genealogies, the ornament of genealogies — and two
  conceptual cosmological views for the coda: an observer with an event horizon and an arrow of time
  pointing inward, a time-sphere with observer/singularity antipodes; the last two are a superstructure
  over the real substrate, `euclid_cosmology.py`).

| 56 | **The Collatz first cause: the decree that fell** | [56](prose/56_CollatzFirstCause.en.md) | `Engine/CollatzFirstCause`, `Engine/CausalClosureAxiom` §18 | 🟢 post-mortem: the boundary taken and REMOVED (the tripwire fired, the law is false); 🟢 the "verification, not derivation" epistemics survived; the conjecture 🔴 open |

🟢 = machine-checked, without `sorry` (standard axioms). 🟡 = AXIOM-TAINTED (conditional on
`step00FirstCause`; exactly **47** declarations — 42 in quarantine + the corollary
`higherEnergyIncompatibility_twins` + **2 geometry declarations** of ch. 49
(`twin_vertices_beyond_every_horizon`, `lines_meet_but_unknowable_from_inside`, via the accepted twin
boundary) + **2 dyadic-source declarations** (`DyadicFirstCause.dyadicOrigin_from_firstCause`,
`dyadicBlowup_is_firstCauseManifestation`, via the `nsBoundary` boundary) — all through accepted
boundaries. There are NO Collatz declarations in the taint any more: the fourth boundary was removed
after its law was refuted. 🔴 = an open node / input.

## Status — honestly

Three colours run through the whole programme, and here we name them plainly.

**The green corpus — machine-proved, under standard axioms, without `sorry`.** The whole of Euclid's
engine and its laws (EPMI: the impossibility of infinite descent, irreversibility, finiteness in a
finite number of steps); the reduction of the twin conjecture to a single block core; the entire
product-core machine (rank-descent 4→1, pigeonhole); the infinitude of the carrier. The former walls —
parity, circular payment, the three rank-descent defects — are all removed. This is the genuinely
checked part: a "green" module cannot be forged, and the verifier's axiom tracker does not let a decree
hide behind a green label.

**The single open node.** The whole twin branch is machine-reduced to one statement —
`TheLastStep00Obligation`: *a finite semantic key resolves genealogy collisions*. It is honest: at
every scale `M0` it itself exhibits a twin-centre above `M0` (that is, it is scale-wise no weaker than
the goal) and exists in a dozen and a half equivalent forms — energetic, embedded, seam. The small
branch `A ≤ 4` we **machine-refuted** (a five-adic chain gives infinitely many genealogies without a
single twin hypothesis), so the node lives only at `A ≥ 5`; its satisfiability there is genuinely open.
`twin_prime_conjecture` remains a `sorry` — this is an honest **reduction, not a proof**. In detail —
[chapter 24](prose/24_BoundaryDecomp.en.md) and [29](prose/29_CarrierBridge.en.md).

**The single axiom — the first cause** ([chapter 33](prose/33_CausalFirstCause.en.md)). The node cannot
be closed from within: its self-grounding would build a perpetual engine, and that is a proved
impossibility. So we accept it **from outside**, by the single axiom `step00FirstCause` — a deliberate
"0 → 1" event with three causal boundaries: the twins (`causalBoundary`), Riemann (`riemannBoundary`)
and Navier–Stokes (`nsBoundary`). A fourth boundary — the Collatz rope law — was taken and REMOVED: the
law was machine-refuted (`ropeLaw_universal_refuted`), the tripwire fired (chapters 55–56). The axiom is
locked in a quarantine module; the verifier marks every declaration that depends on it (exactly 47:
43 in quarantine + 2 geometry of ch. 49 through the accepted twin boundary + 2 dyadic-source through
`nsBoundary`) — there are no leaks into the green line. The honesty is machine-level: the strength of
the decree is exactly the sum of the accepted boundaries, and it is no weaker than its conclusions (to
accept the axiom = to accept the twins, and the same for RH). Knowing the cause from within is
impossible as a theorem (`cause_unknowable`); hence the main theorem above.

**Seven branches around one engine.** Every great question is a shadow of the perpetual-engine
prohibition on its own object, and the outcome is honestly different in each case:

- **Twins** and **Riemann** — a decree boundary 🟡: the node and an off-critical zero are green
  non-presentable, so they can be honestly accepted by axiom
  ([33](prose/33_CausalFirstCause.en.md), [38](prose/38_RiemannFirstCause.en.md)).
- **P/NP** — 🟢 **a theorem with no decree at all**: fast rank traversal provably does not pay for an
  unbounded family of certificates ([39](prose/39_PNPRankPayment.en.md)).
- **Yang–Mills** and **Hodge** — 🟢 conditional theorems: spectral quantisation ⟹ mass gap, the
  descent law ⟹ payment by cycles ([40](prose/40_YangMills.en.md), [42](prose/42_Hodge.en.md)).
- **Navier–Stokes** — 🟢 the cascade and the assembled integral; the gate energy balance survived as
  the third decree boundary ([36](prose/36_NavierStokes.en.md), [41](prose/41_NSSmoothness.en.md)).
- **Mersenne** — a side branch: an honest bridge, all load-bearing inputs 🔴
  ([34](prose/34_MersenneBranch.en.md)).

The recurring lesson, machine-proved across all fronts: **an honest decree boundary exists only where
the "deviation" itself is green non-presentable.** Where the deviation can be forged — frames for P/NP,
spectra for Yang–Mills, profiles for Navier–Stokes, charges for Hodge — the decree either explodes or
is empty, and what remains is a green conditional theorem with an honestly named 🔴 input. The missing
object is every time the same — a **data anchor**: a constructed YM spectrum, a Leray solution, the
`(p,p)`-classes, a machine model — mathlib has none of them. **Not a single Millennium problem is
solved or declared solved.**

**Adversarial honesty.** Four times the internal audit found an empty wrapper before it reached the
showcase — vacuities №1–№4 (a degenerate peel of the node; an uninhabited Riemann rank-jump; a free
`witness` for Mersenne; classically empty decider-fronts for P/NP). All were exposed by machine and
documented in the modules themselves, not painted over — and that is the best argument to trust the
parts that did pass the showcase.

## Build

```sh
lake exe cache get    # precompiled mathlib oleans (v4.31.0)
lake build            # the whole Engine line; exit 0 = checked
lake env lean EuclidsPath/Engine/EPMI.lean   # a quick check of the engine core
```

## Verification

```sh
lake env lean scripts/VerifyAll.lean   # enumerates declarations, counts the taint, self-checks the invariants
```

The verifier walks over every non-internal `EuclidsPath*` theorem/definition, collects the axioms it
depends on, and prints: total declarations, `sorryAx`-tainted, tainted by a non-standard axiom. Then
it **self-checks the two eternal honesty invariants** and fails with a non-zero code if either is
violated: (1) the only non-standard axiom in the whole repository is `step00FirstCause`; (2) the only
`sorryAx`-tainted declaration is `twin_prime_conjecture`. Current run: **20018** declarations, sorryAx
**1**, tainted by a non-standard axiom **47** (the number itself changes with the content and is not
hard-pinned — only the two invariants are).
