# Real instance of the relative-curvature scaffold

A THIN adapter: it instantiates the generic relative-curvature scaffold
(`Step00RelativeOrnamentCurvatureCorrections`) with the project's REAL predicates
— `ActiveSieveSafe` for the safe hole and `EuclidsPath.Residuals.TwinCenterZ` for the
twin center — and discharges everything EXCEPT the hard field.

It introduces no new `structure`, no new safe-hole definition, no new axiom.  It only
adapts real names to the generic scaffold.  The single remaining open input is the
certificate family

  `certs : ∀ M0, 5 ≤ M0 → RelativeCurvatureCertificate ActiveSieveSafe M0`,

whose `relIndex_computed : relIndex = -5` field is the parity-barrier node.

**The field `relIndex_computed` is not discharged by `gaussBonnet_cone3`.  The cone3
computation is intentionally not imported here** — its `-5` is the ABSOLUTE Euler
characteristic of a fixed proof-structure graph (already containing a survivor), not the
relative sieve index at an arbitrary boundary `M0`.  Together with the collapse field
`NoSafeHole → relIndex = 0`, the field `relIndex = -5` forces a safe hole; it does not do
so alone, and it is not proved here.  `twin_prime_conjecture` stays `sorry`.

/-- **The single remaining open mathematical node, named as one object.**  For every horizon
    `M0 ≥ 5`, construct a relative-curvature certificate for the sieve ornament — i.e. prove
    `relIndex = -5` after quotienting by the killed boundary.  This is the parity-barrier goal;
    it is NOT proved here, and it is NOT `gaussBonnet_cone3`.

    Declared `Type` (not `Prop`) because a certificate carries the datum `relIndex : Int`; this is
    exactly the shape of the `certs` parameter above.  The next real step is to discharge THIS by a
    concrete discrete-Morse matching / killed-boundary exactness — not by adding further bridges. -/
